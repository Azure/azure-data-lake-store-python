-------------------
* Add support for automatic refreshing of service principal credentials

0.0.12 (2017-06-20)
-------------------
* Fix a regression with ls returning the top level folder if it has no contents. It now properly returns an empty array if a folder has no children.

0.0.11 (2017-06-02)

* Update to properly create the wheel package during build to ensure all pip packages are available.
* Update folder upload/download to properly throw early in the event that the destination files exist and overwrite was not specified. NOTE: target folder existence (or sub folder existence) does not automatically cause failure. Only leaf node existence will result in failure.

------------------
* Enforce basic SSL utilization to ensure performance due to `GitHub issue 625 <https://github.com/pyca/pyopenssl/issues/625>`

0.0.8 (2017-04-26)
------------------
* Fix server-side throttling retry support. This is not a guarantee that if the server is throttling the upload (or download) it will eventually succeed, but there is now a back-off retry in place to make it more likely.

0.0.7 (2017-04-19)
------------------
* Update the build process to more efficiently handle multi-part namespaces for pip.

0.0.6 (2017-03-15)

------------------
* Fix for downloader to ensure there is access to the source path before creating destination files
* Fix for credential objects to inherit from msrest.authentication for more universal authentication support
* Add support for the following:

  * set_expiry: allows for setting expiration on files

    * set_acl_entries: allows for "patching" an existing ACL on a file or folder
    * get_acl_status: retrieves the ACL information for a file or folder
    * remove_acl_entries: removes the specified entries from an ACL on a file or folder
    * remove_acl: removes all non-default ACL entries from a file or folder
    * remove_default_acl: removes all default ACL entries from a folder

0.0.4 (2017-02-07)
------------------
