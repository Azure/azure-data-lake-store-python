Release History
===============
0.0.8 (2017-04-26)
------------------
* Fix server-side throttling retry support. This is not a guarantee that if the server is throttling the upload (or download) it will eventually succeed, but there is now a back-off retry in place to make it more likely.

0.0.7 (2017-04-19)
------------------
* Update the build process to more efficiently handle multi-part namespaces for pip.

0.0.6 (2017-03-15)
------------------
* Fix an issue with path caching that should drastically improve performance for download

0.0.5 (2017-03-01)
------------------
* Fix for downloader to ensure there is access to the source path before creating destination files
* Fix for credential objects to inherit from msrest.authentication for more universal authentication support
* Add support for the following:

  * set_expiry: allows for setting expiration on files
  * ACL management:
  
    * set_acl: allows for the full replacement of an ACL on a file or folder
    * set_acl_entries: allows for "patching" an existing ACL on a file or folder
    * get_acl_status: retrieves the ACL information for a file or folder
    * remove_acl_entries: removes the specified entries from an ACL on a file or folder
    * remove_acl: removes all non-default ACL entries from a file or folder
